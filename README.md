## Overview

**Project Title**: Task Tracker

**Project Description**: Create a program that allows the user to keep track of tasks and recored them as they are completed.

**Project Goals**: Learn how to use programs in c++. I also want to learn as much as possible without the use of too mcuh AI. If I do use AI I don'y want to copy and paste code over.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure there is some sort program that can run C++ code.
2. Run the code in the debug window, I used it in windows.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Start the program
2. Add a task to the list
3. You can view the list after that
4. You can also mark the task as complete
5. After you have input all the task and marked them appropriatly you can save the file
6. If the tasks are saved the program can be rerun and loaded in.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* C++, I used visual studio Communicty

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [C++ Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)
* [Intodcution to C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4wAmUh-yis)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] All the user to remove tasks if they want.
* [ ] Allow the tasks to be ordered based on priority
* [ ] Number the tasks so they can be edited
